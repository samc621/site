          I started writing code in 2010. At the time, I was a teenager hacking
          things up for fun. Since then, I've had the opportunity to work on
          dozens of projects and lead teams of awesome software engineers
          located all over the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          I founded a full-stack
          <a href="https://techsuite.io" target="_blank">software studio</a> in
          2016 to satisfy my entrepreneurial hunger. We help challenger brands
          unlock new revenue streams by innovating their business models and
          bringing them to new markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          I became enamored with blockchain and crypto in 2017. I'm currently building a 
          <a href="https://equityup.io" target="_blank">decentralized transfer agent</a> that uses 
          smart contracts to reduce cost and avoid counterparty risk in the
          private equity space. I mainly contract but am passionate about
          open source projects and release as much of
          <a href="https://github.com/samc621" target="_blank">my code</a> as
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I’m:
          <ul>
            <li>Building a
            <a href="https://mentat.org" target="_blank">digital work marketplace</a>
            that uses Ethereum smart contracts to create censorship-resistant and
            anonymous access to work with no fees and no down-time.</li>
            <li>Advising a leading
            <a href="https://delphidigital.io" target="_blank">crypto research firm</a>
            that provides investors with institutional-grade analysis and a podcast
            featuring industry leaders.</li>
            <li>Consulting numerous startups on product, marketing, and business strategy.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I’m available for new contracts, both individually and through my digital agency, as well as consulting and advising
        engagements.</p>
